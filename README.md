# My personal README
Hi I'm Josh, I'm a front-end engineer on Team Planet Express and I work on WPE's User Portal.

## My Goals
* Make front-end development feel like this in Portal:

* Become the #1 deletion contributor in Portal (I'm currently #2)

## Things You Should Know About Me
I am not a morning person.

## What I Value
* Shipping code that works and doesn't break.
* I value code that is clear and self-documenting over documentation.
* Viewing software as a liability. The perspective of "less code is better" I think helps me write simpler and clearer code.
* I think code should be optimized for deletability.
* I value working on user stories over accurately estimating them. Predicting the future is hard.
  * You'll learn more from working on a story than talking it to death. When you've learned something can't be done then block the story and move on, keep it agile.
* Writing user stories that focus on what the story does for a user. This can be difficult but that's a feature not a bug.

## The Day-To-Day
* I prefer face to face, small group conversations for nuanced, complex, or personal topics.
* I appreciate asynchronous communication over Slack if meeting isn't required. It helps me preserve heads down development time.
